# Guillermo Borges

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](guillermo-proposal.pdf)
- [Presentation Slides](guillermo-proposal-slides.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] Seems overly ambitious
- [ ] I would not characterise cognition as an auto-encoder 
- [ ] This seems to be too complex an arrangement of networks for the assignment
- [ ] Where is the planning here?


## Part 2

- [Implementation](<link to github>)
- [Final paper](glicks-paper.pdf) - Please submit it to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ap2018)
- [Final presentation slides](glicks-final-presentation-slides.pdf)
